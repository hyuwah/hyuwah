### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Wahyu, a Software Engineer handling mobile development specifically on Android with 5+ years of experience in the startup industry. I was a [Google Certified Associate Android Developer](https://www.credential.net/62f48fc6-dfef-4604-a900-b59a5d2cc17c) from 2019 until 2022. Currently focusing and passionately learning best practices of native Android apps development with Kotlin, Multi Module App Architecture, SOLID & Clean Code, essentially things that make a great software engineer.
